Members will be aware that in July last year the Council on Professional and Technical Education recommended that enrolment in engineering courses at the tertiary level in Singapore should be increased substantially in order to meet the manpower demands of our restructured economy. In particular, the Council recommended that a new institution, to be called the Nanyang Technological Institute, should be established at the former Nanyang University campus in Jurong in order to train practice-oriented engineers who would, on graduation, work in industry, manage our production lines, undertake plant and site supervision and oversee maintenance work. The training of these engineers would emphasize engineering applications and practice.
The Bill before the House seeks to formally establish the Nanyang Technological Institute by legislation. The Bill is patterned along the lines of the National University of Singapore Act, but appropriate modifications have been made where necessary. I shall deal briefly with the significant provisions of the Bill.
Clause 3 of the Bill formally establishes and incorporates the Nanyang Technological Institute. The functions and powers of the Institute are specified in clause 5. The Institute's functions include the provision of facilities to carry out higher instruction and research in various branches of engineering and technology, as well as in such other disciplines as the Institute's Council may determine from time to time. The Institute is also empowered to enter into and carry out such arrangements as the Institute's Council may think fit with the National University of Singapore for the coordination of the work of the Institute with the work of the National University of Singapore, and for the conduct of courses and examinations and for such other purposes as the Institute may, tom time to time, determine.
