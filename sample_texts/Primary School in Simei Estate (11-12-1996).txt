Mr Teo Chong Tee asked the Minister for Education, following the overwhelming demand for primary one places in Changkat Primary School for 1997, whether his Ministry will now consider building another primary school in Simei Estate.
The Senior Minister of State for Education (Encik Sidek bin Saniff) (for the Minister for Education): Mr Speaker, Sir, Simei Estate falls within the Tampines Development Guide Plan (DGP) zone which has 11 primary schools. 
According to our projections, the 11 schools will have sufficient school places to serve the entire DGP up to the year 2000. Under the 5th Primary School Building Programme, the Ministry will build an additional primary school at Tampines Street 33 to cater to demand for primary school places beyond the year 2000. 
It will be ready by the year 2000. At this year's Primary 1 Registration Exercise, there were 189 Primary 1 vacancies in Qiaonan Primary School after completion of registration. The school is less than 1 km from Changkat Primary.
Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi): Sir, may I ask the Senior Minister of State for Education whether he is aware that there is a growing population in Simei Estate, in particular, and there are a lot of young children who are now in our PCF kindergarten education centres? 
So we see a need for a primary school to be built within the Simei Housing Estate. May I request the Senior Minister of State to look further into this matter?
Encik Sidek bin Saniff: Sir, the Ministry is aware of the growing number of school-going children and that is why we are building an additional school at Tampines Street 33.
When the time comes, I am quite sure we will consider the request if there is a necessity. For instance, the Member has asked about Changkat Primary School which is nearest to his constituency. 
My officers have tried their best by increasing the number of places from 400 to 405 next year, though not many, to ensure convenience.
