Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether there are plans to establish a Neighbourhood Police Post in Serangoon North Neighbourhood 5.
The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Peter Sung)(for the Minister for Home Affairs): I am answering on behalf of my Minister, Sir. There is no plan to establish a Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) in Serangoon North Neighbourhood 5. Residents in what used to be the Jalan Kayu Constituency are served by two Neighbourhood Police Posts, one at Block 549 of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 and the other at Block 2 of Seletar Road.
Mr Heng Chiang Meng: Sir, does the Minister of State realise that these two Neighbourhood Police Posts are about 3-4 kilometres away? Surely, he does not think that this is the concept of a Neighbourhood Police Post.
Mr Peter Sung: Mr Speaker, Sir, Serangoon North Neighbourhood 5 is about five minutes walk from another NPP located at Block 108 of Serangoon North Avenue 1.
Mr Heng Chiang Meng: Sir, does this mean that the Ministry's idea is that the Neighbourhood Police Post in Block 108, which is in another constituency, can actually serve residents of my constituency, including block to block visits?
Mr Peter Sung: The answer is yes, Sir.
